              <p>
                I have always been interested in
                knowing how video games work, the logic behind the art of programming,
                and knowing why many programs lack the optimization of others.
                Always willing to learn something new, from success and failure,
                to become a great QA developer.
              </p>

                <h3>Matrices calculator</h3>
                <p>
                  After I learnt about arrays, vectors and the math behind them,
                  I was tasked to develop a complex project as another final
                  project, so I teamed with some other classmates and made a
                  little calculator that could receive two NxN matrices and make
                  addition or multiplication. It also included an option to make
                  a transposed 3x3 matrix of the given matrix.

                <h3>Basic game projects</h3>
                <p>
                  In my learning process at the University, I've been tasked to
                  develop some simple and very known games as final projects in
                  order to show my knowledge, and so I did: Minesweeper and
                  Tic-tac-toe.
                </p>

                <h3>Teaching application</h3>
                <p>
                  Time passes at the University, and the tasks get more complex,
                  this time I was asked to make an app that demonstrates a
                  proper management of the Analysis and Design stages of the
                  Software's lifespan, so I built an app where an administrator
                  receives teaching applications and promotes them to a test
                  stage (to verify the quality of the applicant) or just reject
                  them, with enough application promotions, the applicant would
                  be fully hired. On the other side, the applicants could choose
                  which job they want to apply to, and after submitting an
                  application, they could see the progress of it.

                  With this page, I'm finally starting to worry more about my

                  and presentation of myself once I finish the University, will
                  I be able to accomplish my dream of going back to Spain and
